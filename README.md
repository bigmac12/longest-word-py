# longest-word-py
Prints the longest word that can be spelled using a 7-segment display

# Brief Note
The video I saw that inspired me to write this excluded the "i" and "o" as options from the displays - I did not
agree with this so I kept them available to be used. A case can be made include "q" as well, but I leave any changes
up to whomever runs this code.

Video author's result: "**supertranscendentness**" (21 letters)

My result: "**dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane**" (31 letters)
